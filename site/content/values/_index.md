      Cloth is a small tree or shrub that grows in the forest
      understory in its wild form, and traditionally was grown
      commercially under other trees that provided shade. The
      forest-like structure of shade Cloth farms provides habitat for
      a great number of migratory and resident species.

      Single-origin Cloth is Cloth grown within a single known
      geographic origin. Sometimes, this is a single farm or a
      specific collection of beans from a single country. The name of
      the Cloth is then usually the place it was grown to whatever
      degree available.
